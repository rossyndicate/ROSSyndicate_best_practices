# Workflow Overview

If you are not already a member of the [ROSSyndicate GitHub
Organization](https://github.com/rossyndicate), please Teams Katie Willi to add
you!

## Starting a new repository

1.  From the ROSSyndicate Organization landing page, create a new repository
    ('repo') with the appropriate naming convention (short/concise, no spaces).
    Elect to start the repository with a README.md file and a **MIT use license
    file**. After you've initialized your repository, go in and edit the third
    line of the license file to read: *'ROSS - Radical Open Science Syndicate
    and all contributors'*

2.  Add collaborators with write/push access by going to repo Settings -\>
    Manage Access -\> Invite a Collaborator.

3.  After you have forked the repository to your account, clone the repo to your
    local machine (see Forking and Cloning ROSSyndicate Repositories).

4.  Once the repo is stored on your local machine create the general
    architecture for your repository.

    -   Create a basic folder structure for your project. Below are some folder
        types that you may wish to include at the initiation of your project.

        -   data: folder containing data sourced throughout the pipeline. For
            internal project, this should be a SymLink folder to a OneDrive
            folder (see 'Data and OneDrive') . For external
            projects/deliverables (with datasets that do not trigger large-file
            errors \>100mb), this can be a folder that contains data files that
            travel with and are tracked by the repository.

        -   src: folder containing scripts for the analysis completed in the
            repository.

        -   out/output: folder that contains and tracks output of your pipeline.
            This could include figures, summary data, etc. Your out/output
            folder could also live within the data folder, depending on the size
            of your project output.

    -   Populate the README.md with some basic information, including the
        primary contact for the repo, and what the repo is all about. Also
        include the following use license blurb: *'**This repository is covered
        by the MIT use license. We request that all downstream uses of this work
        be available to the public when possible.**'*

    -   Populate the *.gitignore* to ignore any folders or files that should not
        be tracked. At a minimum, add these to all *.gitignore '*s:

        ```{r, eval = FALSE}
        .Rproj.user
        .Rhistory
        .RData
        .Ruserdata
        .DS_Store 
        **/.DS_Store 
        ```

    -   Create an R project associated with the repository directory.

    -   Commit and push these changes to your forked repository, then create a
        pull request to your creative partner (see 'Collaboration workflow
        overview').

## Forking and Cloning ROSSyndicate Repositories

1.  Go to the ROSSyndicate repo for the project and click "Fork".

2.  Follow the prompts to create a forked repository on your personal GitHub
    account, which is where you will make changes and edits prior to making a
    pull request to incorporate your changes to the primary repository.

3.  Clone your forked repo to your local machine using the terminal in R or a
    command-line interpreter.

    -   Make sure you have navigated to the directory where you would like the
        cloned repository to be stored. See this [tutorial on command-line
        basics](https://www.davidbaumgold.com/tutorials/command-line/) so you
        know how to navigate at the terminal. Most folks in the lab create a
        'GitHub' directory within our Documents folder, but we don't have any
        required location for where you store your local repository.

    -   Then, clone your repo! You can acquire the `ssh_address` from your
        forked repository on the GitHub website. If I were cloning the repo
        below, I would replace `ssh_address` with
        `git@github.com:steeleb/ROSSyndicate_best_practices.`

        > git clone ssh_address

## Collaborative Coding

(Note, the workflow for this is slightly different if you are working in feature
branches. Please see that section if you are working in feature branches.)

1.  Always start your day by fetching upstream changes from the primary
    repository by typing the following in the terminal. This is part of the way
    we avoid merge conflicts down the road.

    > git fetch upstream

2.  Work on your local repo, commit, edit, commit, edit, commit. See 'Commit
    history best practices' for advice on great commits. Commits are made in
    your terminal with the following commands:

    > git status

    This will show you what files have changes, and which are staged for your
    commit.

    ![](images/git%20status.png){width="550"}

3.  Now, stage the files for your commit.

    > git add filename.ext filename2.ext

    Check to see that you've staged the correct files for your commit with git
    status It will look like this:

    ![](images/git%20add.png){width="550"}

    If you are happy with the files listed under 'Changes to be committed', make
    a commit!

    > git commit -m "insert commit message here"

4.  Push your commit history to your forked repository.

    > git push origin main

5.  Submit a pull request to your internal creative partner or engage other
    members of your project team through a pull request. See 'Pull Request best
    practices' below for details.

    -   Navigate to your forked repository.

    -   Confirm that your branch is up-to-date with the upstream repo by
        clicking on 'Sync fork'.

        ![](images/Screenshot%202023-07-27%20at%201.36.24%20PM.png)

    -   Then, click 'Contribute' and 'Open pull request'.

        ![](images/Screenshot%202023-07-27%20at%201.38.07%20PM.png){width="250"}

6.  Craft and submit your PR!

    -   Add a title and description of your pull request, making sure your PR
        conforms to the 'Pull Request best practices' recommendations. Pull
        request descriptions and comments are written in Markdown, so take
        advantage of embedding images, emojis, text blocks, etc. You can also
        associate specific commits and issues with markdown text using the hash
        '\#'.

    -   Check "Allow edits from maintainers" to allow other collaborators to
        make changes to your pull request and in the right hand side, assign a
        reviewer (in this case, your internal creative partner or whomever you'd
        like to engage in this pull request).

        ![](images/request%20review.png){width="250"}

    -   Click "Create Pull Request".

7.  Internal creative partner (or engaged individuals) reviews the pull request
    according to 'Pull Request Review best practices' following the process
    outlined in GitHub's [How to Review Pull
    Requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests/about-pull-request-reviews).
    If no changes are required, the reviewer will merge the branch, but if any
    comments have been made on the pull request, leave the merging to the PR
    author.

## Addressing merge conflicts

There are multiple ways to deal with merge conflicts. You can address them
within the [GitHub conflict
editor](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-on-github).
Alternatively, you can use the command-line method is [described
here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line),
but this method requires some advanced skill and understanding of command line
git. If you're using VSCode, and have the 'GitHub Pull Requests and Issues'
extension installed, this is a very user-friendly way to deal with conflicts,
too.

```{r, echo = F}
knitr::wrap_rmd('02-Workflow-Overview.Rmd', width = 80, backup = NULL)
#note, this will not wrap text that are prefaced by any special characters (like bullets!)
```
